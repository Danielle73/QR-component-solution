## Overview

This is my submission of the QR code component challenge. Within this challenge I tried to match the criteria as closely as possible. I used the w3schools how to design a product card ( https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_product_card.asp ), and what I had so far learnt from Dr Angela Yu's Web development course to complete the challenge ( https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp ).

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

This was a good revision practice in responsiveness, margins and paddings. Using web developer tools on firefox was a huge help in continuing to solidfy the differences, as well as being able to visually see the changes necessary before applying them to my code.  


### Continued development

I will continue to practice layout and further strengthen flexbox. 

### Useful resources

- [w3schools.com - How to product card](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_product_card.asp) - This helped me to create the card component. This really helped to explain step by step what to do to achieve the effect needed, provided a clear visual example, and allowed for the demo code to be manipulated to see different effects. 

- [w3schools.com - How to responsive image](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_image_responsive.asp) - A great tutorial in helping to achieve a responsive image.
